A B-tree of order M is a tree with the following structural properties:

- The root is either a leaf or has between 2 and M children
- All nonleaf nodes have between [M/2] and M children
- All leaves are at the same depth

This definition is one of the popular forms. A popular alternative structure allows the actual data to be stored in both leaves and internal nodes, as is done in binary search trees. The real use of B-trees lies in datbase systems, where the tree is kept on a physical disk instead of main memory.
