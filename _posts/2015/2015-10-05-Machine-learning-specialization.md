## Case study for machine learning.
Pretty interesting course and spend about 2 hours for one part. Cool applications for machine learning such as the company [compology](http://compology.com/) which use deep learning technique to detect full garbage cans to dynamic routing built for waste. According to their course, they install camera on the trash cans and they do not have tons of labeled data(we know that deep learning need lots of data to do computation). They use deep features(keep the weight for first few neural which was trained by using millions of data) and human marking the depth of trash cans to learn a detector. That's a good way to train a 8 layer neural network with only a few data, cause weights for the first few net are fixed.
