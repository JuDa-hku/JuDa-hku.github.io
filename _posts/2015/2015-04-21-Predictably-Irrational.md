A fantastic book [Predictably Irrational](http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248).

## The Truth about Relativity
Everything is relative. People rarely choose things in absolute terms, people depend on relativity feelings or prices to make choices. I do not how much I would like to pay to watch the SPURS final game but at least I would like to pay more than the semi-final match. The author also gives us the example that *Economist* try to sell its subscription and offer three choices, first internet-only $59, second print-only option $125, and third both internet and print $125. When we see all these three choice, we all know the third one is better than the second but we may not know that it  has influenced us deeply in our brain, we may treat the $125 for internet and print choice much more acceptable. The graph to prove that we are always looking at the things around in relation to others. We can't help it. ![relative](/png/relative.png?raw=true) Another trick people often use is to bring the wing-man (someone similar color, body type but slightly less attractive) to the bar to date girls easily. You have a "-youself" and girls will have a higher probability to date with you. Relativity not only helps us make decisions but also make us downright miserable. Jealousy and envy spring from comparing our lot in life with that of others. Just like one old saying "Not good enough won't afflict us, but when friends are terrific, it will".  Guess what will happen if the information in your company's salary database became known? People may feel happy  with their income, but when they hear their friends' yachts and vacation homes, they suddenly feel very poor. The take away lesson we can all learn: the more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity.


##The Fallacy of Supply and Demand
The author show another irrational part of human being that we can be manipulated like goslings. Goslings, upon breaking out of eggs, become attached to the first moving object they encounter. We are also largely influenced by the first impression. Companies set the first impression or the initial price (anchor) price such as, the diamond which was once regarded valueless and become invaluable now. In our age, when we first encounter the diamond, the first price is up in the air and there are so many meaningful stuff attached to it. We become anchored to the price once we buy a new product at a particular price. The real example include the manufacturer's suggested retail price for cars, cloth or computer. The price tags are not necessarily anchors and these price become anchors when we contemplated buying a product or service at the particular price. That may explain when travelers from China go to Hongkong, they shop luxury goods, make-up but less good. They remain anchored to the prices that they pay in their city. But people will also adjust their anchors.  Take me for example, when I first eat outside the campus, I am shocked by the dish price. I choose a cheap one and it is better than the dishes in the campus. Next time, I want to eat lunch and the ideal decision-making process should take into account the pleasure, the cost of walking, and the money I spend. But people resort to simple choice. I once choose to enjoy lunch outside, and it should be a good choice for me. And I will very likely repeat this pattern. How will these company do to set the anchors to their costumers? Startbucks make a difference and do everything in its power to make the experience feel difference -- so different that we would not use the prices of Nescafe cafe as an anchor. Instead, we would like to open an new anchor for it and this is why it is so successful. Tom in the **The Adventures of Tom Sawyer** turned the whitewashing of Aunt Polly's fence into an exercise in manipulating his friends. He said "Do you call this work. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?" Tom's friends not only payed Tom for the work, but also derived real pleasure from the task. Mark Twain also observed "There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work, and then they would resign" In term of our personal lives, if we aware of this irrational behaviors, we should start question habit, how did a daily ice-cream begin? Ask yourself what amount of pleasure you will be getting our of it. Do you have a better choice then your habit?  We should pay extra attention to the first decision we make as it will be the start of a long stream of decisions. The last advice is, it is time to inventory the imprints and anchors in our own life. Scorates said the unexamined life is not worth living. Even if our choice was once completely reasonable, are they still reasonable?


##The Cost of Zero Cost
Which deal you will choose? 1. $10 Amazon gift card for free. 2. $20 Amazon gift card for 9 dollars. Another example is when it is open day for park, museum or other facilities, people would more likely to be there. Is it a good choice to be there?  We can always find these places are overcrowded when it is free. The line is long,  we can hardly see anything and fighting the crowds and in the place is unpleasant. Do you realize it may be a mistake?  Zero is a emotional hot button!! How this happen? The author explains that most transactions have an upside and downside. We are born to be afraid of losing things but when something is free! We forget the downside. When a cup of coffee is free, we forget the time spent in the long line, and the hurt to our sleep. The free shipping on orders over a certain amount in Amazon increase sales dramatically. According to my own experience, I prefer to get the free shipping through buying more items, even though the shipping fee is just $0.99. 

##The Cost of Social Norms
Why we are happy to do things, but not when we are paid to do them? Mummy takes care of us with all their effort. If we said that for all the love, I want to pay $1000, mom would definitely be angry. What's going on here? The author suggest that we live simultaneously in two different worlds-- one where social norms prevail, and the other where market norms make the rules. The social norms include the friendly requests that people make of one another. Instant paybacks are not required. It provides pleasure for both of you, and reciprocity is not immediately required. The market norms, on the other hand, requires wages, prices, rents, interest, and costs-and-benefits. When we keep social norms and market norms separately, life goes along pretty well. If we mix these two norms, trouble comes. Image you date with a girls three to four times and spend a lot of moneys. In one data, you mentioned that how much the relationship cost you and you deserve something back. You have crossed the line. Remember the words of Woody Allen: "The most expensive sex is free sex." The author also illustrates when a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. The take away advise is ask a friend(a statistician) to help move a few boxes is fine. But asking him to spend the same time to analysis dataset for you--free--is not. Because statistician will naturally connect the data analysis work with market norms. Companies also see the advantage of establishing social relationship. Think about the birthday greeting to you.


##The Influence of Arousal and The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control
The author consider the performance of the same people in two different emotional state. The result shows we always underpredicts the effect of passion on our behavior. Moreover,the study suggested that our inability to understand ourselves in a different emotional state does not seem to improve with experience. Then is it possible to do some when we are really angry, hungry, frightened, or sexually aroused? When we are criticized by our boss publicly, we might response with a vehement e-mail. But wouldn't be better putting our reply in the 'draft' folder for a few days.

Why we can't make ourselves do what we want to do? Procrastination is giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification. When we plan to exercise regularly, we find a reason to sit all day in front of the television. As for the diet, I'll take the chocolate and begin the diet tomorrow. When we promise to do something, we often in the cool state. We often ruin it when we are driven our emotion to eat chocolate, to have a better computer and so on. What can we do to better control ourselves? Each of the problems we face has potential self-control mechanisms. If we don't have the will to eat vegetables alone, we can eat in the company of our friends.

##The High Price of Ownership
Why we overvalue what we have? As the author told us, human beings are afraid of losing things and they always focus on what they will lose. Think about how much would I buy a NBA ticket for spurs? and how much would I sell this ticket? Survey has confirmed that people always prefer pay less and charge more, (of course this survey ask one group how much you would buy and another group how much you would sell). We fall in love with what we already have. When you decide to sell your house, you recall the beautiful memory in the house rather than think about the money we will gain(used to buy other stuffs). You are very likely to post a higher price than it deserves. ownership is not limited to material things. It is also applied to points of view. Think about how many times you shout loudly or argue with others to defend your view, like the GDP is the best NBA player association ever~~.

##Keeping Doors Open
Why options distract us from our main objective? The author use Xiang Yu as the example to convey us what human can do when they only have only one choice. In the context of today's world, we work just as feverishly to keep all our options open. We end up with several majors but not know any major throughly. We end up with a computer with kinds of useless software or the newest operating system whose utilities won't never be used. We need to drop out of committees that are a waste of our time. Suppose you have closed so many of your doors that have just two left. This is the most difficult things in the world. Use the old story here. A hungry donkey approaches a barn one day looking for hay and discovers two haystacks of identical size at the two opposite sides of the barn. The donkey stands in the middle of the barn between the two haystacks, not knowing which to select. Hours go by, but he still can't make up his mind. Unable to decide, the donkey eventually dies of starvation. Even the author is the victim of the decision-making, when he choose to work for two different universities.

##The Effect of Expectations
The author did the experiment by using beers. This makes me think about the experiment of red wine. Specialists use kinds of indicator to prove the red wine from old world (France, England, etc) is much better than new world (America, Peru, etc) red wine. Researchers remove the tag of red wind and invite them to identify these wines. The result shocks and shows there is no evidence to show that the old world wine is better. But when the tag attached, specialists insist they can feel the difference. Another example is the Coke to Pepsi. Expectations can influence nearly every aspect of our life. We can add small things that sound exotic and fashionable to our cooking introduction such as (chipotle-mango sauces, buffalo instead of beef). These ingredients might not make the dish delicious; but by changing our expectations, they can effectively influence the taste when we have the pre-knowledge. The techniques is especially useful when you persuade children to try new dishes. Also, we use the power of presentation to increase the expectation for food.

##The Power of Price
The author consider the role that *price* plays in the placebo effect. The placebo effect is important when we try to prove some kinds of drugs are useful. The author use the same placebo but attach different price on them. The result shows the placebo with a higher price is more useful than the cheaper one.

##The Context of Our Character
The author try to answer the question "Do people tend to cheat when they have a change to do so?" and "What can we do to decrease the possibility". He showed people cheat when they have a chance to do so, but don't cheat as much as they could. Moreover, once they begin thinking about honesty by recalling the Then Commandments or by signing a simple statement (the non-cheat statement of HKU ~~), they stop cheating completely (of course in the experiment). We have learned that people cheat, but whether people would cheat more for tokens than for cash. The experiment shows when the benefit is one step away from cash, we can fast rationalize dishonesty. Take me for example, I may take papers back home (feel sorry~) but never stole money from my office. Another example is the expense reports. Buying a strange a ticket to a local museum is out of bounds but buying the same stranger $8 drink is easy to justify. How can we fix this? We need to wake up to the connection between nonmonetary currency and our tendency to cheat.

## Beer and Free Lunches
**Go back to the book**, and see how and why the author spend so much money to provide beer to strange !!
